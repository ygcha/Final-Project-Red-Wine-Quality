# Final Project: Red Wine Quality

## Project Overview
Over the course of the last decade, there has been a rise in consumer interest in wine, which has contributed to the expansion of the wine business. As a direct result of this, businesses are increasing their investments in cutting-edge technologies in order to boost wine production and sales. The quality certification stage is an essential part of both procedures, and as of right now, it relies heavily on human specialists conducting tastings of the wine. For this project, I will be using the Red Wine Quality Data Set from UCI Machine Learning Repository. The dataset is related to red variants of the Portuguese "Vinho Verde" wine. The dataset is comprised of a total of 12 variables, each of which was documented for each of the 1,599 observations. To see which of the 11 input variables are likely to affect the quality of red wine the most, I ran a correlation analysis of our independent variables against our dependent variable, quality.
